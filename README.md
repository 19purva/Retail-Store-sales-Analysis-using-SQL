 # Retail Store Sales Analysis

## Overview

The Retail Store Sales Analysis project is focused on cleaning, analyzing, and deriving insights from a synthetic retail dataset. This dataset simulates real-world sales data with intentional inconsistencies and missing values to provide hands-on experience with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and SQL-based data manipulation. The dataset includes 11,362 rows and represents sales transactions across multiple product categories in a retail store.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:  
1.To clean and preprocess the dataset by addressing missing, inconsistent, and erroneous data.  
2.To perform advanced SQL queries for data analysis and reporting.  
3.To derive actionable insights about customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.  
4.To identify and resolve issues in the dataset for enhanced data integrity and usability.
